# :ledger: Blind Auction Smart Contract

A simple blind auction contract inspired by the code example in official [Solidity](https://solidity.org) documentation guide written with little adjustments and full unit tests via the [Truffle Suite](https://trufflesuite.com) framework.

## :watch: Quick Start

It is assumed you have [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org) LTS installed and knows how to use **package managers** e.g NPM, PNPM, Yarn etc.
To test the contract follow the steps below:

1. Install the dependencies from the `package.json` file.
2. Run `truffle develop` to start the development console from your terminal.
3. Then run `test` once the truffle development console is already running. This starts the script to start unit tests.
